Random Password Generator
=========================
Generate random passwords for websites in Safari.

This is based off of the `Password Generator for Chrome`_, which in turn is a
Chrome extension of `Nic Wolfe's`_ `password generator`_.  It combines a master
password along with the domain name of the site you're visiting to create a
random password.
